# This file contains the paths to programs used by the HAM-ART pipeline
# The pipeline only reads in lines without starting #
#
# Each software  has an internal identifier (first column)
# a recommended number of CPUs / threads and/or memory to use (second column)
# and a path to the executable (third colum)
#
# Please don't change the internal identifier!
# If you have the software in your path, leave the executable name in the third column
# If the software is not in your path, please provide the full path to the executable
# Please change the number of CPUs / threads / memory if you don't have the required amount available
#
# The pipeline was optimised on a system with maximum of 32 CPU cores.
# If you have more CPU cores / threads available, you may increase the performance of those
# applications that have a reccomended CPU cores set to 32
